### At the top right corner of the dashboard, there are filters that allow for interactive data analysis
Region:
The user can select a specific region to filter the data across the entire dashboard and view results only for the chosen geographic area (e.g., West, Northeast, Midwest, etc.).

Invoice Date:
This filter allows for selecting a date range, enabling the user to analyze sales data for a specific time period. By default, the range is set from 2020-01-01 to 2021-12-31.
These filters are useful for customizing the data view to meet analytical needs, such as comparing results across regions or examining performance within specific time periods.
